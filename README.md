# CODSOFT_Task2
Welcome to the **CODSOFT_Task2** repository! This project contains the implementation for Task 2 of the CODSOFT internship/assignment series.

## Project Overview
This repository focuses on **Customer Churn Prediction** using machine learning techniques. The main notebook, `CUSTOMER CHURN  PREDICTION.ipynb`, demonstrates the end-to-end process of analyzing customer data, building predictive models, and evaluating their performance to identify customers who are likely to churn.

## Dataset
- **Churn_Modelling.csv**  
  This file contains the customer data used for the churn prediction project.  
  - Each row represents a customer, with columns such as:
    - `CreditScore`, `Geography`, `Gender`, `Age`, `Tenure`, `Balance`, `NumOfProducts`, `HasCrCard`, `IsActiveMember`, `EstimatedSalary`, and `Exited` (churn label).

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation (using various classification algorithms)
- Visualization of results
- Interpretation of model outputs
